# Gov4Git roadmapping together

Welcome, free thinkers!

This project is dedicated to brainstorming and roadmapping for Gov4Git.

This is no ordinary GitHub repo. Its issues and pull requests are governed by Gov4Git.

This is our way of dogfooding Gov4Git and including the community in our deliberations.

## Get started

Go on, [install the Gov4Git app](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git?tab=readme-ov-file#install-the-desktop-app) and request to join this community using its addess `https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap` in the app.

We will approve your request to become a collaborator and issue participation credits to you.

## Participate

Here's how this works. 

### Deliberate issues

- [Create an issue](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/new)

- Gov4Git will let you know when it starts managing the issue, in a comment like [this one](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/7#issuecomment-1902123664)

- A managed issue is associated with a _priority_ (score), which reflects its importance according to the community

- All collaborators can influence the priority of an issue by spending credits for or against it in the app. Priority scores are updated every few minutes and reported in a comment on the issue like [this one](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/7#issuecomment-1902197926)

- Credits spent on prioritizing an issue are held as bounty to be rewarded to the author of the pull request which eventually resolves the issue

### Deliberate pull requests

- Submit a PR and specify which issues the PR is claiming to resolve. To claim an issue, include the following text anywhere in the description of the PR.
     ```
     claims https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER
     ```

- You can change PR descriptions at any time. Gov4Git knows what to do.

- Gov4Git will let you know when it starts managing the PR, in a comment like [this one](XXX)

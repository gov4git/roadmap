# Gov4Git roadmapping together

Welcome, free thinkers!!

This project is dedicated to brainstorming and roadmapping for Gov4Git.

This is no ordinary GitHub repo. Its issues and pull requests are governed by Gov4Git.

This is our way of dogfooding Gov4Git and including the community in our deliberations.

## Get started

Go on, [install the Gov4Git app](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git?tab=readme-ov-file#install-the-desktop-app) and request to join this community using its address `https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap` in the app.

We will approve your request to become a collaborator and issue participation credits to you.

## Participate

Here's how this works.

### Deliberate issues

- [Create an issue](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/new)

- Gov4Git will let you know when it starts managing the issue, in a comment like [this one](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/7#issuecomment-1902123664)

- When an issue is managed it is associated with a _priority_ (score), which reflects its importance according to the community

- Collaborators can influence the priority of an issue by spending credits for or against it in the app. Priority scores are updated every few minutes and reported in a comment on the issue like [this one](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/7#issuecomment-1902197926)

- Credits spent on prioritizing an issue are held as bounty to be rewarded to the author of the pull request which eventually resolves the issue

- If an issue is closed manually, the bounty will be refunded to the collaborators.

### Deliberate pull requests

- Submit a PR and specify which issues the PR is claiming to resolve. To claim an issue, include the following text anywhere in the description of the PR.
     ```
     claims https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER
     ```
     See for example [this PR](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/pull/10#issue-2092196314).


- You can change PR descriptions at any time. Gov4Git knows what to do.

- Gov4Git will let you know when it starts managing the PR, in a comment like [this one](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/pull/10#issuecomment-1902235538)

- When a PR is managed it is associated with an _approval_ (score), which reflects its fitness for merging according to the community

- Collaborators can weigh in on PR approval scores by spending credits for or against it in the app. The latest approval score will be reported in a comment like [this one](https://github.com/gov4git/roadmap/pull/10#issuecomment-1904429781).

- Project maintainers have the final say on whether a PR is merged or closed unmerged, using the familiar GitHub UI.

- If a PR is merged, the author will be awarded the bounties of all claimed issues and the issues will be closed automatically. Otherwise, the credits spent on PR approval will be refunded to the reviewers.
